# Simple Keylogger

This project is a basic keylogger built in Python, designed for educational and ethical purposes. It logs keystrokes with timestamps and saves them to a log file. The program emphasizes user consent and provides an option to specify the duration for which keystrokes are logged.

## Features

- **User Consent**: A disclaimer is displayed, and the user must accept the terms before running the keylogger.
- **Time-Limited Logging**: Users can specify how long the keylogger should run.
- **Timestamped Keystrokes**: Each keystroke is logged with a timestamp for clarity.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Focused on simplicity, making it easy to understand and use for educational purposes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Maharkk/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
    cd ethical-keylogger
    ```

2. Install the required Python library:
    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```

2. You will be prompted to agree to the disclaimer and set a time limit for logging keystrokes.

3. Once the time limit is reached, the keystrokes will be saved to `keystrokes_log.txt`.
